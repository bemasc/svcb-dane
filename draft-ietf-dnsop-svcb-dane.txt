 Using DNSSEC Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) with DNS Service
                        Bindings (SVCB) and QUIC
                   draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-dane-latest

Abstract

   Service Binding (SVCB) records introduce a new form of name
   indirection in DNS.  They also convey information about the
   endpoint's supported protocols, such as whether QUIC transport is
   available.  This document specifies how DNS-Based Authentication of
   Named Entities (DANE) interacts with Service Bindings to secure
   connections, including use of port numbers and transport protocols
   discovered via SVCB queries.  The "_quic" transport name label is
   introduced to distinguish TLSA records for DTLS and QUIC.

1.  Introduction

   The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities specification
   [RFC7671] explains how clients locate the TLSA record for a service
   of interest, starting with knowledge of the service's hostname,
   transport, and port number.  These are concatenated, forming a name
   like _8080._tcp.example.com.  It also specifies how clients should
   locate the TLSA records when one or more CNAME records are present,
   aliasing either the hostname or the initial TLSA query name, and the
   resulting server names used in TLS or DTLS.

   There are various DNS records other than CNAME that add indirection
   to the host resolution process, requiring similar specifications.
   Thus, [RFC7672] describes how DANE interacts with MX records, and
   [RFC7673] describes its interaction with SRV records.

   This document describes the interaction of DANE with indirection via
   Service Bindings [SVCB], i.e. SVCB-compatible records such as SVCB
   and HTTPS.  It also explains how to use DANE with new TLS-based
   transports such as QUIC.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The contents of this document apply equally to all SVCB-compatible
   record types, such as SVCB and HTTPS records.  For brevity, the
   abbrevation "SVCB" is used to refer to these record types generally.

3.  Using DANE with Service Bindings (SVCB)

   Section 6 of [RFC7671] says:

      With protocols that support explicit transport redirection via DNS
      MX records, SRV records, or other similar records, the TLSA base
      domain is based on the redirected transport endpoint rather than
      the origin domain.

   This document applies the same logic to SVCB-compatible records.
   Specifically, if SVCB resolution was entirely secure (including any
   AliasMode records and/or CNAMEs), then for each connection attempt
   derived from a SVCB-compatible record,

   *  The initial TLSA base domain MUST be the final SVCB TargetName
      used for this connection attempt.  (Names appearing earlier in a
      resolution chain are not used.)

   *  The transport prefix MUST be the transport of this connection
      attempt (possibly influenced by the "alpn" SvcParam).

   *  The port prefix MUST be the port number of this connection attempt
      (possibly influenced by the "port" SvcParam).

   Resolution security is assessed according to the criteria in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC6698].

   If the initial TLSA base domain is the start of a secure CNAME chain,
   clients MUST first try to use the end of the chain as the TLSA base
   domain, with fallback to the initial base domain, as described in
   Section 7 of [RFC7671].  However, domain owners SHOULD NOT place a
   CNAME record on a SVCB TargetName, as this arrangement is unusual,
   inefficient, and at risk for deprecation in a future revision.

   If any TLSA QNAME is aliased by a CNAME, clients MUST follow the TLSA
   CNAME to complete the resolution of the TLSA records.  (This does not
   alter the TLSA base domain.)

   If a TLSA RRSet is securely resolved, the client MUST set the SNI to
   the TLSA base domain of the RRSet.  In usage modes other than DANE-
   EE(3), the client MUST validate that the certificate covers this base
   domain, and MUST NOT require it to cover any other domain.

   If the client has SVCB-optional behavior (as defined in Section 3 of
   [SVCB]), it MUST use the standard DANE logic described in Section 4.1
   of [RFC6698] when falling back to non-SVCB connection.

4.  Adding a TLSA protocol prefix for QUIC

   Section 3 of [RFC6698] defines the protocol prefix used for
   constructing TLSA QNAMEs, and says:

      The transport names defined for this protocol are "tcp", "udp",
      and "sctp".

   When this text was written, there was exactly one TLS-based protocol
   defined for each of these transports.  However, with the introduction
   of QUIC [RFC9000], there are now multiple TLS-derived protocols that
   can operate over UDP, even on the same port.  To distinguish the
   availability and configuration of DTLS and QUIC, this document
   updates the above sentence as follows:

      The transport names defined for this protocol are "tcp" (TLS over
      TCP [RFC8446]), "udp" (DTLS [RFC9147]), "sctp" (TLS over SCTP
      [RFC3436]), and "quic" (QUIC [RFC9000]).

5.  Operational considerations

5.1.  Recommended configurations

   Service consumers are expected to use a CNAME or SVCB AliasMode
   record to point at provider-controlled records when possible, e.g.:

   alias.example.                  HTTPS 0 xyz.provider.example.
   www.alias.example.              CNAME xyz.provider.example.
   xyz.provider.example.           HTTPS 1 . alpn=h2 ...
   xyz.provider.example.           A     192.0.2.1
   _443._tcp.xyz.provider.example. TLSA  ...

   If the service needs its own SvcParamKeys, it cannot use CNAME or
   AliasMode, so it publishes its own SVCB ServiceMode record with
   SvcParams that are compatible with the provider, e.g.:

   _dns.dns.example. HTTPS 1 xyz.provider.example. ( alpn=h2 ...
                                                     dohpath=/doh{?dns} )

   For ease of management, providers may want to alias various TLSA
   QNAMEs to a single RRSet:

   _443._tcp.xyz.provider.example. CNAME dane-central.provider.example.
   dane-central.provider.example.  TLSA  ...

   Any DANE certificate usage mode is compatible with SVCB, but the
   usage guidelines from Section 4 of [RFC7671] continue to apply.

5.2.  Unintended pinning

   As noted in Section 6 of [RFC7671], DANE encounters operational
   difficulties when the TLSA RRset is published by an entity other than
   the service provider.  For example, a customer might copy the TLSA
   records into their own zone, rather than publishing an alias to the
   TLSA RRset hosted in the service provider's zone.  When the service
   subsequently rotates its TLS keys, DANE authentication will fail,
   resulting in an outage for this customer.  Accordingly, zone owners
   MUST NOT publish TLSA records for public keys that are not under
   their control unless they have an explicit arrangement with the key
   holder.

   To prevent the above misconfiguration and ensure that TLS keys can be
   rotated freely, service operators MAY reject TLS connections whose
   SNI does not correspond to an approved TLSA base domain.

   Service Bindings also enable any third party consumer to publish
   fixed SvcParams for the service.  This can cause an outage or service
   degradation if the service makes a backward-incompatible
   configuration change.  Accordingly, zone owners should avoid
   publishing SvcParams for a TargetName that they do not control, and
   service operators should exercise caution when making incompatible
   configuration changes.

6.  Security Considerations

   The use of TLSA records specified in this document is independent for
   each SVCB connection attempt.  In environments where DANE is
   optional, this means that the client might use DANE for some
   connection attempts but not others when processing a single SVCB
   RRSet.

   This document only specifies the use of TLSA records when all
   relevant DNS records (including SVCB, TLSA, and CNAME records) were
   resolved securely.  If any of these resolutions were insecure (as
   defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC4035]), the client MUST NOT rely on the
   TLSA record for connection security.  However, if the client would
   otherwise have used an insecure plaintext transport, it MAY use an
   insecure resolution result to achieve opportunistic security.

   Certain protocols that can run over TLS, such as HTTP/1.0, do not
   confirm the name of the service after connecting.  With DANE, these
   protocols are subject to an Unknown Key Share (UKS) attack, in which
   the client believes it is connecting to the attacker's domain, but is
   actually connecting to an unaffiliated victim domain
   [I-D.barnes-dane-uks-00].  Clients SHOULD NOT use DANE with
   vulnerable protocols.  (HTTP/1.1 and later and encrypted DNS are not
   normally vulnerable to UKS attacks, but see Appendix A for some
   important exceptions.)

7.  Examples

   The following examples demonstrate Service Binding interaction with
   TLSA base domain selection.

   All of the RRSets below are assumed fully-secure with all related
   DNSSEC record types omitted for brevity.

7.1.  HTTPS ServiceMode

   Given service URI https://api.example.com and record:

   api.example.com. HTTPS 1 .

   The TLSA QNAME is _443._tcp.api.example.com.

7.2.  HTTPS AliasMode

   Given service URI https://api.example.com and records:

   api.example.com.     HTTPS 0 svc4.example.net.
   svc4.example.net.    HTTPS 0 xyz.cdn.example.
   xyz.cdn.example.     A     192.0.2.1

   The TLSA QNAME is _443._tcp.xyz.cdn.example.

7.3.  QUIC and CNAME

   Given service URI https://www.example.com and records:

   www.example.com.  CNAME api.example.com.
   api.example.com.  HTTPS 1 svc4.example.net alpn=h2,h3 port=8443
   svc4.example.net. CNAME xyz.cdn.example.

   If the connection attempt is using HTTP/3, the transport label is set
   to _quic; otherwise _tcp is used.

   The initial TLSA QNAME would be one of:

   *  _8443._quic.xyz.cdn.example

   *  _8443._tcp.xyz.cdn.example

   If no TLSA record is found, the fallback TLSA QNAME would be one of:

   *  _8443._quic.svc4.example.net

   *  _8443._tcp.svc4.example.net

7.4.  DNS ServiceMode

   Given a DNS server dns.example.com and record:

   _dns.dns.example.com. SVCB 1 dns.my-dns-host.example. alpn=dot

   The TLSA QNAME is _853._tcp.dns.my-dns-host.example.  The port and
   protocol are inferred from the "dot" ALPN value.

7.5.  DNS AliasMode

   Given a DNS server dns.example.com and records:

   _dns.dns.example.com.     SVCB 0 dns.my-dns-host.example.
   dns.my-dns-host.example.  SVCB 1 . alpn=doq

   The TLSA QNAME is _853._quic.dns.my-dns-host.example.  The port and
   protocol are inferred from the "doq" ALPN value.

7.6.  New scheme ServiceMode

   Given service URI foo://api.example.com:8443 and record:

   _8443._foo.api.example.com. SVCB 1 api.example.com.

   The TLSA QNAME is _8443._$PROTO.api.example.com, where $PROTO is the
   appropriate value for the client-selected transport as discussed in
   Section 4 .

7.7.  New scheme AliasMode

   Given service URI foo://api.example.com:8443 and records:

   _8443._foo.api.example.com. SVCB 0 svc4.example.net.
   svc4.example.net.           SVCB 1 .
   svc4.example.net.           A    192.0.2.1

   The TLSA QNAME is _8443._$PROTO.svc4.example.net (with $PROTO as
   above).  This is the same if the ServiceMode record is absent.

7.8.  New protocols

   Given service URI foo://api.example.com:8443 and records:

   _8443._foo.api.example.com. SVCB 0 svc4.example.net.
   svc4.example.net. SVCB 3 . alpn=foo,bar port=8004

   The TLSA QNAME is _8004._$PROTO1.svc4.example.net or
   _8004._$PROTO2.svc4.example.net, where $PROTO1 and $PROTO2 are the
   transport prefixes appropriate for "foo" and "bar" respectively.
   (Note that SVCB requires each ALPN to unambiguously indicate a
   transport.)

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "Underscored and
   Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry ([RFC8552], Section 4):

                +=========+============+=================+
                | RR Type | _NODE NAME | Reference       |
                +=========+============+=================+
                | TLSA    | _quic      | (This document) |
                +---------+------------+-----------------+

Appendix A.  Unknown Key-Share Attacks

   In the Unknown Key-Share (UKS) Attack [I-D.barnes-dane-uks-00], a
   hostile domain ("attacker.example") claims the IP addresses and TLSA
   records of another domain ("victim.example").  A client who attempts
   to connect to "attacker.example" will actually be connecting to
   "victim.example".

   The client then sends some commands or requests over this connection.
   If the server rejects these requests, or if the attacker could have
   forwarded these requests itself, the attack confers no advantage.
   However, if the client issues commands that the attacker could not
   have issued, and the victim does not ignore these requests, then the
   attack could change state at the victim server, reveal confidential
   information to the attacker (e.g., via same-origin data sharing in
   the client), or waste resources.

   Here are some examples of requests that the attacker likely could not
   have issued themselves:

   *  Requests authenticated using a TLS Client Certificate or other
      credential that is bound to the connection but not the domain.

   *  Requests that are only permitted if they appear to come from a
      particular IP range.

   This section lists some protocols that can be used with SVCB,
   analyzes their vulnerability to this attack, and indicates any
   resulting restrictions on their use:

   *  HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0: *Vulnerable*

      -  Clients MUST NOT use TLS Client Authentication with DANE and
         these protocol versions.

         o  Example attack: "https://attacker.example/" fetches
            "/profile" in Javascript.  The second request is directed to
            "victim.example" and authenticated by a client certificate,
            revealing the user's profile to the attacker.

      -  Use of these protocol versions with DANE is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   *  HTTP/1.1 and later: *Slightly Vulnerable*

      -  The CONNECT method ([RFC9110], Section 3.6) MUST NOT be used on
         a connection authenticated with DANE.

         o  Example attack: "attacker.example" advertises a CONNECT
            proxy service to existing customers of the "victim.example"
            proxy, which is access-controlled by client IP.  To reduce
            its own operating costs, "attacker.example" uses UKS to send
            users back to "victim.example", resulting in the attacker's
            service appearing to work but silently consuming clients'
            transfer quota on "victim.example".

      -  Clients MAY use all other methods with DANE, including Extended
         CONNECT [RFC8441].  These methods are defended from
         misdirection attacks by server verification of the Host or
         :authority header ([RFC9110], Section 7.4).

   *  DNS over TLS, DTLS, or QUIC [RFC7858][RFC8094][RFC9250]:

      -  For resolution: *Not Vulnerable*

         o  DNS resolution does not change state at the server, reveal
            confidential information to the attacker, or waste
            significant resources.

      -  For other uses: *Mitigation Required*

         o  When using DNS for other purposes such as zone transfers
            [RFC9103], clients relying on DANE for server authentication
            MUST NOT use a client certificate that is authorized by
            multiple potentially hostile servers.
