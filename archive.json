The response could include the header `Alt-Svc: http/1.1=\"endpoint.example.com:443\"`.\r\n\r\nA subsequent request might be directed at `endpoint.example`, with the same SNI and TLSA record (based on [RFC 7838](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7838)). Thus, no certificate for `endpoint.example` is requested or needed.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, a client that supports HTTPS records would connect to `endpoint.example`, using an SNI of `endpoint.example` and comparing it to the TLSA record at `_443._tcp.endpoint.example`. This means that a certificate for `endpoint.example` *is* required, and a certificate for `origin.example` is never used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIs this the intended behavior? It strikes me as rather confusing, if so: an example explicitly demonstrating this would be welcome. Alt-Svc headers and HTTPS records are equivalent in most respects, so such a divergence is worth noting.",

It also specifies the _quic underscored DNS node name to designate the QUIC transport.\r\n\r\nSection 1, last word of first paragraph: maybe \"TLS\" -> \"TLS/DTLS\".\r\n\r\nThis document would benefit from some additional terminology definitions in Section 2 for such things as SvcParam and SNI.
